Overview
-----------

   As part of the lab environment, we have already deployed the Azure Stack HCI 22H2 Cluster, so you don't have to deploy it and you can continue adding it to Windows Admin Center and verify the registration of the cluster within Azure to unlock the full functionality.

   Azure Stack HCI 22H2 is delivered as an Azure service and needs to register within 30 days of installation per the Azure Online Services Terms.  With our cluster configured, we'll now register your Azure Stack HCI 22H2 cluster with **Azure Arc** for monitoring, support, billing, and hybrid services. Upon registration, an Azure Resource Manager resource is created to represent each on-premises Azure Stack HCI 22H2 cluster, effectively extending the Azure management plane to Azure Stack HCI 22H2. Information is periodically synced between the Azure resource and the on-premises cluster.  One great aspect of Azure Stack HCI 22H2, is that the Azure Arc registration is a native capability of Azure Stack HCI 22H2, so there is no agent required.


## Task 1: Add the existing Cluster to Windows Admin Center

This Lab also includes a dedicated Windows Admin Center (WAC) gateway server. The WAC gateway server can be accessed by connecting to it from RDP. A shortcut is available on the HCIBox-Client desktop.

1. Open this shortcut and use the domain credential (arcedemo@jumpstart.local) to start an RDP session to the Windows Admin Center VM.

![-](./media/wac_gateway_shortcut.png "Screenshot showing WAC desktop shortcut")

2. Log in to the WAC gateway server using the domain credential.

![-](./media/wac_gateway_login.png "Screenshot showing logging into the WAC server")

3. Now you can open the Windows Admin Center shortcut on the WAC server desktop. Once again you will use your domain account to access WAC.

![-](./media/wac_gateway_desktop.png "Screenshot showing logging into WAC")
![-](./media/wac_login.png "Screenshot showing WAC login prompt")

The first time you access the Windows Admin Center you will get a Welcome screen "Successfully installed version 2211". Just close it and now wait (+- 2minutes) until all WAC extensions are installed and you get a popup window telling you "Successfully updated your extensions". Just click [OK]. Windows Admin Center will automatically refresh.

1. Now that we are logged in, our first step is to add a connection to our HCI cluster. Click on the “Add” button, and then click on “Add” under “Server clusters”.

![-](./media/wac_empty.png "Screenshot showing WAC first login")
![-](./media/wac_add_cluster.png "Screenshot showing WAC adding cluster")

5. Enter “hciboxcluster” for the cluster name, and use the domain account credential to connect to the cluster.

![-](./media/wac_add_cluster_detail_2.png "Screenshot showing WAC connection details")

6. Now that the cluster is added, we can explore management capabilities for the cluster inside of WAC. Click on the cluster to drill into its details.

![-](./media/wac_cluster_added.png "Screenshot showing cluster list")
![-](./media/wac_cluster_added_detail.png "Screenshot showing cluster detail")

You just successfully added the existing Azure Stack HCI 22H2 Cluster "hciboxcluster" to you Windows Admin Center. We will explore the Cluster capabilities leveraging WAC in upcoming tasks.

## Task 2: Verify your Azure Stack HCI 22H2 Cluster is registered with Azure

**Within this lab the Azure Stack HCI 22H2 cluster is already registered within Azure.**

To verify the registration let's now use **PowerShell**.

We're going to perform the registration verification from the **AdminCenter** machine, which we've been using to access Windows Admin Center.

1. After logging in to the **AdminCenter** VM, click on the windows button and search for **PowerShell ISE** then right-click on it to select **Run as administrator**.

![-](./media/2023-03-01_17h07_52.png "Open PowerShell ISE as an Administrator")
    
2. Copy and paste the below PowerShell commands and execute them, you will now see 

     ```powershell
     Invoke-Command -ComputerName AzSHOST1 -ScriptBlock {
     Get-AzureStackHCI
     } 
     ```
    
    ![Check updated registration status with PowerShell](./media/Verify-registered-cluster.png "Check updated registration status with PowerShell")

You can see the **RegistrationStatus**, the **ConnectionStatus** and **LastConnected** time, which is usually within the last day unless the cluster is temporarily disconnected from the Internet. An Azure Stack HCI 22H2 cluster can operate fully offline for up to 30 consecutive days.

You can close the Windows PowerShell ISE. No need to save the PowerShell script.

## Task 3: Register Windows Admin Center in Azure

To use Azure services with Windows Admin Center, you must register your Windows Admin Center instance with Azure. This is a prerequisite if you use Windows Admin Center to [register Azure Stack HCI with Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/deploy/register-with-azure).

1. In Windows Admin Center, select the Settings gear icon from the top right corner of the page.

2. From the Settings menu in the left pane, go to Gateway > Register.

3. Select the Register button on the center of the page. The registration pane appears on the right of the page.
   
![Register Windows Admin Center](./media/register-wac.png "Register Windows Admin Center in Azure")

4. Iin the **Get started with Azure in Windows Admin Center** blade, follow the instructions to **Copy the code**(2) and then click on the link **Enter the Code**(3) to configure device login.

   ![Installed extensions in Windows Admin Center](./media/login.png "Installed extensions in Windows Admin Center")
    
5. Now, Paste the code you copied in previous step and click on **Next** button.

   ![Installed extensions in Windows Admin Center](./media/code.png "Installed extensions in Windows Admin Center")
     
6. When prompted for credentials, **enter your Azure credentials** for a tenant you'd like to use to register the Windows Admin Center and click on **Continue** button if you get any popup saying **Are you trying to sign in to Windows Admin Center?**.

7. Now, navigate back in **Windows Admin Center** tab, you'll notice your tenant information has been added.  You can click on **Connect** to connect Windows Admin Center to Azure.

    ![Connecting Windows Admin Center to Azure](./media/connect.png "Connecting Windows Admin Center to Azure")

8. Click on **Sign in** and when prompted for credentials, **enter your Azure credentials** and you will see a popup **Permissions requested**. Check the box next to the **Consent on behalf of your organization** then click **Accept**. *Ignore the Hybridhost001 referral in the screenshot*

    ![Permissions for Windows Admin Center](./media/ex2-task1-step10.png)

*******************************************************************************************************

**NOTE** - If you receive an error when signing in, still in **Settings**, under **User**, click on **Account** and click **Sign-in**. You should then be prompted for Azure credentials and permissions, to which you can then click **Accept**. Sometimes it just takes a few moments from Windows Admin Center creating the Azure AD application and being able to sign in. Retry the sign-in until you've successfully signed in.
**NOTE** - Sometime even after cluster is registered it may show an error with SignIn with following error, you can ignore that and close the popup:
   ```AADSTS700016: Application with identifier '******************' was not found in the directory 'Azure HOL ****'. This can happen if the application has not been installed by the administrator of the tenant or consented to by any user in the tenant. You may have sent your authentication request to the wrong tenant.```

*******************************************************************************************************

## Task 4: Validate Azure integration

Additional permissions were applied on the Windows Admin Center Azure AD application that was created when you connected Windows Admin Center to Azure, earlier. In this step, we'll quickly validate those permissions.

1. Still in Windows Admin Center, click on the **Settings** gear in the top-right corner
2. Under **Gateway**, click **Register**. You should see your previously registered Azure AD app:

    ![Your Azure AD app in Windows Admin Center](./media/WAC-Registered.png "Your Azure AD app in Windows Admin Center")

3. Click on **View in Azure** to be taken to the Azure AD app portal, where you should see information about this app, including permissions required. If you're prompted to log in, provide appropriate credentials.
4. Once logged in, under **Configured permissions**, you should see a few permissions listed with the status **Granted for...** and the name of your tenant. The **Microsoft Graph (5)** API permissions will show as **not granted** but this will be updated upon deployment

5. Under **Configured permissions**, click on **Grant Admin Consent for Azure HOL** button.

    ![Confirm Azure AD app permissions in Windows Admin Center](../media/Ex2-task2-01.1.png "Confirm Azure AD app permissions in Windows Admin Center")
    
6.  Now select **Yes** on the **Grant admin consent confirmation** pop-up to give your app the permissions.

    ![Confirm Azure AD app permissions in Windows Admin Center](../media/Ex2-task2-01.2.png "Confirm Azure AD app permissions in Windows Admin Center")

*******************************************************************************************************

**NOTE** - If you don't see Microsoft Graph listed in the API permissions, you can either [re-register Windows Admin Center using steps here](#configure-windows-admin-center "re-register Windows Admin Center using steps here") for the permissions to appear correctly, or manually add the **Microsoft Graph Appliation.ReadWrite.All** permission. To manually add the permission:

- Click **+ Add a permission**
- Select **Microsoft Graph**, then **Delegated permissions**
- Search for **Application.ReadWrite.All**, then if required, expand the **Application** dropdown
- Select the **checkbox** and click **Add permissions**

*******************************************************************************************************

6. Switch back to the **Windows Admin Center tab** and click on **Windows Admin Center** in the top-left corner to return to the home page. 

    ![Confirm Azure AD app permissions in Windows Admin Center](./media/wac_admin.png "Confirm Azure AD app permissions in Windows Admin Center")
    You'll notice that multiple servers are already under management of Windows Admin Center.
