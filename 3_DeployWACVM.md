Task 1: Explore the existing volumes created on the **hciboxcluster**
-----------
In this step, you'll review a volume on the Azure Stack HCI 22H2 cluster by using Windows Admin Center, and enable data deduplication and compression.

### Review a two-way mirror volume created to run VMs ###

1. Open **Windows Admin Center** on the **AdminCenter** VM. On the top left click on **All connections** and click on your previously deployed cluster, **hciboxcluster.jumpstart.local**

    ![Review the existing volumes for VMs](./media/ReviewVolumes-1.png "WAC Review HCI cluster Volumes")
    
        
2. On the left hand navigation, under **Cluster resources** select **Volumes**.  The central **Volumes** page shows you a total of two volumes

    ![Review the existing volumes for VMs](./media/ReviewVolumes-2.png "WAC Review HCI cluster Volumes")
    
3. On the **Volumes** page, select the **Inventory** tab

    ![Review the existing volumes for VMs](./media/ReviewVolumes-3.png "WAC Review HCI cluster Volumes")
    
4. Open the volume **S2D_vDISK1**, by clicking on the name of the volume. We see a couple of things now:
   
   **NOTE:** Invest enough time to read through the provided documentation as it covers some important information

   - The Volume File system is a **Cluster Shared Volume** of type **ReFS**
     - *Please read more:* 
       - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/concepts/plan-volume
       - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/concepts/storage-spaces-direct-overview)
   - The **Resiliency** was set to **Two-way mirror**
     - *Please read more:*
       - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/concepts/fault-tolerance)
   - **Deduplication** and **Encryption** is **Off**
     - *Please read more:*
       - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/manage/volume-encryption-deduplication
   - Also have a look at the Capacity and Performance indicators
  
      ![Review the existing volumes for VMs](./media/ReviewVolumes-4.png "WAC Review HCI cluster Volumes")
  
5. On the volume **S2D_vDISK1** page click on **Settings**. You will notice that the volume **S2D_vDISK1** has been provisioned as a type **Fixed**, but **Thin** provisioning of volumes is also available.
   - *Please read more:*
     - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/manage/thin-provisioning

        ![Review the existing volumes for VMs](./media/ReviewVolumes-5.png "WAC Review HCI cluster Volumes")

You now have reviewed and learned more about Azure Stack HCI volumes. This **S2D_vDISK1** volume is ready to accept workloads. 

Please also review the official documentation on how to create volumes on Azure Stack HCI, leveraging Windows Admin Center or PowerShell: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/manage/create-volumes

Task 2: Download .Iso files
-----------
In this step, you will download a Windows Server 2022 and Ubuntu Server 22.04 .Iso file and upload the .Iso to your Clustered Shared Volume you explored in Task 1. 

**_NOTE:_**  Make sure to use the Edge browser on the **AdminCenter** VM to execute the following steps.

## Download the .ISO files ##
### Download a Windows Server 2022 .Iso ###

1. Please download Windows Server 2022 image file from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2022)
 
2. In the English (United States) row select the Click **64-bit edition** in the ISO downloads row. Download the .iso which will be by saved in the Downloads folder.

### Download an Ubuntu Server 22.04 .Iso ### 
 
1. Please download Ubuntu Server 22.04 image file from [here](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/ubuntu-22.04.2-live-server-amd64.iso)
 
2. The download of the ISO file should automatically start. Once completed you should find it in your Downloads folder.

## Upload the .ISO files ##
### Upload the .Iso files to your CSV ###
 
1. Open **Windows Admin Center** on **AdminCenter** VM from the desktop if it is not already opened, click on your previously deployed cluster, **hciboxcluster.jumpstart.local**
 
    ![Review the existing volumes for VMs](./media/ReviewVolumes-1.png "WAC Review HCI cluster Volumes")
 
2. On the left hand navigation, under **Cluster Resources** select **Servers** and then **Inventory**.
 
    ![Upload .Iso files](./media/Upload-1.png "Upload .Iso files")

3. Select node AzSHOST1 and then click **Manage**
 
    ![Upload .Iso files](./media/Upload-2.png "Upload .Iso files")
 
4. On the left, select **Files & file sharing**. Open the folder **C:\ClusterStorage\S2D_vDISK1**
  
    ![Upload .Iso files](./media/Upload-3.png "Upload .Iso files")
 
5. Click **Upload**. Click **Select Files**, search and select both (Windows Server 2022 and Ubuntu Server 22.04) .iso files in the Downloads directory and click **Open**, and then click **Submit**. 
 
    ![Upload .Iso files](./media/Upload-4.png "Upload .Iso files")
  
**NOTE:** It can take up to around 5-10 minutes to get both .ISO files successfully uploaded. Maybe a good time to grab a coffee ;-). Once both .ISO files are successfully uploaded you can move on to the next Task.

Task 3: Deploy a Windows Server 2022 virtual machine
----- 
In this step, you will deploy a Windows Server 2022 virtual machine via Windows Admin Center.

    ![Create VM](./media/vm001-9.png "Create VM on Azure Stack HCI 22H2") 
 
11. The VM will be in the UEFI boot summary as below
 
    ![Create VM](./media/vm001-10.png "Create VM on Azure Stack HCI 22H2") 
 
12. Click in "Send Ctrl + Alt + Del" at the top of the page now and press any key when you see the message "Press any key at boot from CD or DVD…"
 
    ![Create VM](./media/vm001-11.png "Create VM on Azure Stack HCI 22H2")

    ![Create VM](./media/vm001-12.png "Create VM on Azure Stack HCI 22H2") 
 
15. Accept the license terms. Click **Next**. Select "Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)" and then Next. It will take around 10 minutes for the VM to boot. After that, please insert the lab credentials **ArcPassword123!!** and your VM is ready to go!

16. Once the virtual machine is up and running try to login!

**NOTE:** You will notice that the VM did not received a proper IPv4 address from the DHCP server. If you want to fix this you can open the VM001 settings page and under Networking you can change the VLAN ID from 2 to 200. 

![Create VM](./media/vm001-vlan200.png "Create VM on Azure Stack HCI 22H2") 

If everything went well your Windows Server should now receive a proper IPv4 Address.

You just finalized the installation of a new Window Server 2022 VM on your Azure Stack HCI Cluster. Please proceed to the next Task.

The final step we'll cover is using Windows Admin Center to live migrate VM002 from it's current node, to an alternate node in the cluster.

1. Still within the **Windows Admin Center** on **AdminCenter** VM, under **Cluster Resources**, click on **Virtual machines**

2. On the **Virtual machines** page, select the **Inventory** tab

3. Under **Host server**, make a note of the node that VM002 is currently running on.  You may need to expand the column width to see the name

    ![Create VM](./media/LiveMigrate-1.png "Create VM on Azure Stack HCI 22H2")

4. Next to **VM002**, click the tick box next to VM002, then click **More**.  You'll notice you can Clone, Domain Join and also Move the VM. Click **Move**

    ![Create VM](./media/LiveMigrate-2.png "Create VM on Azure Stack HCI 22H2")

    ![Create VM](./media/LiveMigrate-4.png "Create VM on Azure Stack HCI 22H2")

You've successfully moved a running VM without downtime using the Windows Admin Center to another Host in the Azure Stack HCI cluster!

Summary
-----------
In this exercise, you have been exploring the existing Cluster Shared Volume which was created for you on Azure Stack HCI cluster. You also looked at more details and options related to the Volumes you can create in Azure Stack HCI. In Task 2 you downloaded some ISO files which you have used in Task 3 and Task 4 to respectively deployed a Windows Server 2022 VM and an Ubuntu 22.04 VM on the Azure Stack HCI Cluster. You finished this exercise by testing a Live migration of the Linux based VM to another available Azure Stack HCI Cluster node.

With this completed, you can now move on to the next exercise. Click [Here](4_ArcEnableWACVM.md) to start the 4rd exercise.
